# Escape the Maze Game

This project is a maze game based off the `Wolfenstein 1981` game. It uses the concept of Raycasting to give a first-person player view. The map is created using 2D-matrix arrays, which are seen when the player's raycast touch the blocks of the map.

I created this project because I wanted to explore game development,something I've been interested in but never had the chance before to do so.



## Technologies Used
- [**C Programming Language**](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-gcc-the-c-compiler-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa-linux) - The project was done using C programming language. 
- [**SDL2**](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation) - Known as `Simple DirectMedia Layer` is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. 

## Usage
On the terminal run
```
make
```

This creates the executable file `raycast` (which is currently in this GitHub repository). Then run this to start up the application.

```
./raycast
```
